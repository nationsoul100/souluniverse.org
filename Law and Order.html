<br><br> Technology (Amendment) Act Section in all nations the act can “intercept, monitor, and decrypt any information for protecting sovereignty, national security, friendly relations with international governments, integrating public order etc.”<br><br> But this regulatory framework of surveillance is lacking in certain areas, which raise the rights implications for citizens and bring forward concerns that such a broad sweep may undermine the democratic fabric of the nation. 


At present, the legislations have cracks that allow state actors to perform targeted surveillance at their discretion in the absence of appropriate checks and balances.

National security isn’t just about protecting borders—it’s about protecting information.<br><br> Governments rely on artificial intelligence and data analysis to predict, prevent, and respond to threats in real-time. AI scans massive amounts of information to detect patterns that human analysts might miss. It can identify cyberattacks before they spread or detect unusual financial transactions linked to criminal activities.</p></dd>

<dd> <p class="left-paragraph">This shift toward AI-driven security has created a demand for professionals who can analyse intelligence, interpret risks, and develop defence strategies. An intelligence studies degree prepares individuals for roles in cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and data-driven defence operations.<br><br> As threats become more complex, the need for skilled experts continues to rise.

Another powerful tool is open-source intelligence (OSINT). Governments monitor publicly available data from social media, news reports, and satellite imagery to track potential security risks.<br><br> This allows analysts to detect misinformation campaigns, uncover extremist networks, and predict emerging conflicts. However, it also raises concerns about mass surveillance and the ethical limits of data collection.

<br><br> AI is also enhancing biometric security. Facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and voice authentication are now standard in airports, government buildings, and secure facilities. These technologies help law enforcement track suspects and prevent unauthorised access to sensitive locations.<br><br> However, they also spark debates about privacy. Critics argue that widespread biometric tracking could lead to excessive government monitoring, with citizens being watched at all times.</p></dd>

<dd><p class="left-paragraph">As a country SOUL, our Sovereignty duty to empower our citizens towards their rights is as important as our duty to preserve national security. National security and privacy have largely been viewed as competing interests over the years;<br><br> however, with the advent of technology and means of digital surveillance, protecting citizens’ information is also important. It is perhaps the best time to begin to view protecting the privacy and information of citizen’s as a facet of preserving national security.<br><br> At present, the legislation thrust apparent through the amendments making new wide exemptions to government and allied agencies in the proposed Data Protection are taking the route that prefers to exempt or weaken privacy practices towards citizens as opposed to putting in place privacy-respecting practices.<br><br> An unfortunate consequence of adopting such methods is that often this compromises the privacy and security of law-abiding citizens themselves.</p></dd>

 <dd><p class="left-paragraph">The existence, stability, and prosperity in each country are tied to the ability to protect their people, fields, resources, and strategic interests from threats, both internal and external. From traditional armed conflict to modern cyber threats, the concept of security has developed significantly
Implementing security and surveillance systems provides numerous benefits, significantly enhancing safety and security for both residential and commercial properties.<br><br> One of the primary advantages is crime deterrence.
security cameras would prompt them to seek an alternative target. This demonstrates the effectiveness of surveillance systems in discouraging potential criminal activities
Another notable advantage is the collection of evidence.<br><br> Security cameras can capture high-definition footage, which is invaluable for law enforcement agencies during investigations. For instance, video evidence can facilitate the identification of suspects, corroborate witness statements, and provide a clear timeline of events.<br><br> In many cases, such footage has been pivotal in the successful prosecution of criminals, thereby enhancing the overall justice system.
Remote monitoring is another significant benefit of modern security systems. With advancements in technology</p></dd>

<h3>Public Safety and Crime Prevention</h3>
<dd><p class="left-paragraph"> Systems play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and preventing crime. By strategically positioning cameras in public areas, authorities can closely monitor activities and intervene swiftly when necessary.<br><br> This proactive approach significantly contributes to reducing crime rates and deterring potential offenders. The presence of surveillance cameras alone often acts as a deterrent, making individuals think twice before engaging in criminal activities.
<br><br> Moreover, surveillance systems are invaluable tools for law enforcement agencies during investigations.</p></dd>
<dd><p class="left-paragraph"> Video footage can provide critical evidence, helping police identify suspects, understand crime patterns, and solve cases more efficiently. For instance, the use of surveillance footage was instrumental in swiftly apprehending the suspects involved in the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.<br><br> Such case studies highlight the effectiveness of these systems in facilitating prompt and accurate investigative processes.
In addition to aiding law enforcement, surveillance systems foster a sense of security within communities.<br><br> When residents know that their neighbourhood is under constant watch, they feel safer and more protected. This increased sense of security can lead to stronger community ties and a collective effort to maintain public safety.</p></dd>
