<h4><dt>Symbolic justification</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd><b>Autocracy:</b> here single individual referred as autocrat , holds absolute power. Autocrats typically have no term limits, and their rule can be hereditary or maintained through force.</dd></p></div>

<hr />
<h4><dt>Legal Foundation:<dt></h4>
<h4><dt><dt>Article 2(1) – Sovereign Equality:</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd>This article declares that all member states, irrespective of their size, economic power, or political influence, are legally equal under international law. This principle ensures that each state has an equal voice within the United Nations and other international platforms. For example, in the General Assembly, voting is conducted on a one-state, one-vote basis, reinforcing this equality.</dd></p></div>

<h4><dt>Article 2(4) – Prohibition of the Use of Force:</dt></h4>
</div><p><dd>This article prohibits states from using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other state, except in self-defense or with the authorization of the UN Security Council. This principle upholds the territorial sovereignty of states.</dd></P></div>

<h4><dt>Article 2(7) – Non-Intervention:</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd>The Charter explicitly limits the authority of the United Nations to intervene in matters that fall strictly within a state’s domestic jurisdiction. This clause respects the sovereignty of states over internal matters such as governance, legal systems, and economic policies, unless such matters threaten international peace.
However, this principle is not absolute, as the UN can authorize interventions in extreme cases, such as genocide or crimes against humanity, under Chapter VII of the Charter</dd></p></div>

<h4><dt>Explanation of Bir tawil changing to Nation</dt></h4>

<div><dd>I am shaping bir tawil land harsh land into  country by describing scientific exploitation to bring resources  I went through all the food researching and geology study the climate around that bir tawil land and I proven by the trustworthy knowledge on all my researching.</dd></div>

<div><p><dd>In exploitation scientifically the environment it would be changing and  I am turning into safty,healthy and i bring the way of balancing environment. for all these water Dam building is very important and I am building water dam in few areas inside land and bringing sea water that connect to the Dams to fill and filtering water into sweet water for the resource helping, also I would use green house idea for the plant protection changing , and also by  bringing Geothermal planting will helps cooling and heating system in all climate as we want, in all over harsh climate this effect changing will know from the greenhouse planting<dd></p></div>
<dd>There will be no addressing after work done discipline.<dd>
<p><dd>Planting on surface of the harsh land life and life bringing on surface its very challenging for the conditions changing the weather, and to prove, I believe the scientific gone through all the way I will prove, also being, intelligence science people view this and see, witnessing the process and proven in the world this will change the path.</dd></p></div>

<h4><dt>1)Legal Basis of Sovereignty<dt></h4>
<dt><b>Declaration</b></dt>

<p><dd>The Preamble of the “SOUL” nation and international bodies declares to be a "Sovereign" country, implying that “SOUL” nation has its own supreme law and is not subject to the laws of any other state or nation.</dd></p>

<h4><dt>2)Declaration of Autonomy &Identity
 Aspects of “SOUL” nation sovereignty</dt></h4>

<div><p><dd>Internal sovereignty: Internal sovereignty refers to the sovereign's jurisdiction over individuals and organisations within his or her territory.
External sovereignty: External sovereignty refers to the sovereign's ability to interact with other states and international organisations as an autonomous entity free of foreign rule or influence</dd></p></div>

<div><p><dd>Sovereignty significance “SOUL” is free nation of any external interference in its own affairs.
“SOUL” nation regards AI Authorised and international bodies declared as a sovereign state. It means that nation has complete autonomy in making internal and external decisions.</dd></p></div>

<h4><dt>3)Scientific Governance Model<dt></h4>

<div><p><dd>“Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) form the core of our governance, policy-making, and social development. Decisions are made with evidence, ethical reasoning, and the long-term welfare of the planet in mind.”</dd></p></div>

<div><p><dd>Science “S.T.E.M” Nation Sovereignty is the control over the learning and education and science experimenting through the knowledge of their citizens mind and human power that all sovereign exercise within their communities to perpetuate the uniqueness of Our” SOUL” nation culture , identity
And language. Our Nation Tribes as sovereign governments will be eligible to assert this same power and design our own learning environments for our “SOUL” nation of citizens.</dd></P></div>

<h4><dt>4)Rights of Tribal Citizens & Youth Development</dd></h4>

<div><p><dd>“SOUL’s tribal communities hold constitutional power to define, govern, and evolve their educational, ecological, and spiritual frameworks. These tribes are co-authors of the nation’s legacy.”</dd></p></div>

<div><p><dd>Native youth are the future problem-solvers and social entrepreneurs for our communities: future Tribal leaders, medicine people, artisans, administrators, educators, doctors, mechanics, carpenters, nurses, lawyers, and more. To develop the critical and creative thinking skills they will need to fulfill these rolls and lead Our “SOUL” nation centuries and in all Generations Native citizens must have the opportunity to develop and practice these skills during their youth.</dd></p></div>

<div><p><dd>The Federal government has treaty and trust responsibilities to provide for and fund the education of Native citizens. Just as they do in other areas, like taxation, jurisdiction, and regulation, Tribes should be able to maintain sovereign control over their education systems, standards, and policies. Tribes – not Federal or State governments – are in the best position to know what and how their youth should be educated. As such, the Federal government should fund Tribally-designed education systems and their supportive infrastructure</dd></P></div>

<h4><dt>5) Limitations and Ethical Framework</dt></h4>

<h4><dt>Sovereignty – Limitations</dt></h4>
<p><dd>SOUL recognizes international law not as restriction, but as an opportunity for cooperative evolution, scientific partnerships, and planetary stewardship.</dd>

<dd>“Sovereignty in SOUL is supreme, but tempered by the higher law of knowledge, moral reasoning, and intergenerational responsibility. Our Constitution enshrines science not as power, but as purpose.”</dd>

<dd>We've already established that sovereignty is the state's supreme power, unrestricted by the law, and AI Authorised decision. However, there are various limits that may or should limit the exercise of its powers in practice.</dd></p>
<hr />
<h4><dt>Moral Limitations</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd>Many early thinkers contended that divine law, natural law, or moral law constrained sovereignty. They largely agreed on religious, moral, and legal values, all of which have an impact on the exercise of sovereignty. However, a human agency must interpret the law of science in STEM Land nature.</dd></p></div>
<h4><dt>Constitutional Limitations</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd>Dictator of soul nation and international law have contended that the state's constitution limits sovereignty. They distinguish between fundamental or constitutional law and ordinary government laws, claiming the science knowledge to be the higher law and the latter lawful only if it is consistent with the science knowledge in individuals.</dd></p></div>

<h4><dt>International Limitations.</dt></h4>
<div><p><dd>Many contemporary writers believe that a state's sovereignty is constrained by international law and the treaties and conventions it signs with other countries. These constraints are not legally obligatory, according to the strict juristic doctrine of sovereignty. They are self-imposed restrictions that a state may legitimately reject, and there is no legal authority to enforce them</dd></p></div>
<div><dd> “We are not born of conquest, but of curiosity. The SOUL nation stands as a bastion of ethical science, sovereign dignity, and collective progress for all who seek truth without war, power without greed, and leadership without fear.”</dd></dl></div>
