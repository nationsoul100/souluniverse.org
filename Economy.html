<p>Sustainable development lacks a single detailed and widely accepted definition. As a general approach to human development, it is frequently understood to encompass most if not all of the following goals, ideals, and values:</p>
<li><span style="color: darkgreen;"> A global perspective on social, economic, and environmental policies that takes into account the needs of future generations</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: darkgreen;">A recognition of the instrumental value of a sound natural environment, including the importance of biodiversity</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: darkgreen;">The protection and appreciation of the needs of Indigenous cultures</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: darkgreen;">The cultivation of economic and social equity in societies throughout the world</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: darkgreen;">The responsible and transparent implementation of government policies</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="color: darkgreen;">The intellectual underpinnings of sustainable development lie in modern natural resource management, the 20th-century conservation and environmentalism movements, and progressive views of economic development.</span>
