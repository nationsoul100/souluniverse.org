<p><b>Main Food Crops used for civilians</b> that give different types of verity food at all conditions
Mainly Wheat and Rice
Food chemistry that interact with hot land that grow’s in the heat conditions.
Two major important food crop that grown in the global which is most important used and taken Wheat and Rice followed by Maize (Zea), Barley (Hordeum), Oats (Avena), Rye (Secale),Millet (Pennisetum), Sorghum (Sorghum) and so on grown others also.
We have mentioned 2 important wheat and rice which is important in the middle or the globle travellers and our treaties.<br><br>
Geological condition of heat climate soil surface takes the conditions changes that react on plants forms a life grown in the heat conditions.
Fruits and vegetables plants trees water and air collection and reactions studies in the land
<br>Most important chemistry on fruits food that to understand react of the surface of soil heat climate
By using Innovation technology used by Greenhouse planting all crops, and cultivation, growing made easy and simple if carefully follow by protecting
Wheat is a versatile grain used in a wide variety of food products, including bread, pasta, baked goods, and breakfast cereals.
<br>Wheat is a staple ingredient in many cuisines around the world, contributing to a diverse array of food products. Its unique properties make it essential for baking, cooking, and even animal feed, highlighting its importance in both human diets and agricultural practices
<p><b>Wheat chemical components:</b>
Carbohydrates, Proteins, lipids, Vitamins, Minerals, and enzymes. These components contribute to the nutritional, value and functional properties.
<br><br><b>Wheat cultivation :</b>	The primary conclusions of the review are as follows: The following are some of the ways that heat stress affects wheat: 
<br><br>
(1) A substantial reduction in plant water use efficiency, seed germination, seedling growth, and cell turgidity; <br><br>
(2)Decreased grain yield: Heat stress at crucial wheat growth phases, like flowering and grain filling, can result in poor grain set, reduced grain size, and lower overall yield;<br><br>
 (3) the growth of oxidative damage to the chloroplasts, the senescence of leaves, the reduction of photosynthesis, and the inactivation of the enzymes responsible for photosynthetic processes; <br><br>
(4) HS also affects the length, growth rate, assimilate translocation, and grain settling, this so affects the grain number and size; <br><br>
(5) Some techniques for controlling heat stress in wheat include breeding, discovering quantitative trait loci that confer heat resistance, introducing exogenous protective chemicals to seeds or plants, Using marker-assisted selection and field testing to screen the available germplasm; <br><br>
(6) Increase susceptibility to pests and diseases: stressed plants are more susceptible to pest & disease attacks, which can further reduce yield potential; <br><br>
(7) Integrated agronomic & genetic management techniques may increase wheat's resistance to heat.<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Rice:</b>
  Rice containing mainly carbo hydrate and some protein, with virally no fat and sugar cooked rice contains a lot of water, making up almost 70% of its total weight, white and brown rice have similar calorie, carbo hydrate, protein and fact content.<br><br>
It is Influenced by genetic and environmental factor’s the germ, the pericarp and aleurone layers which are richer than endosperm in nutrients like protein, minerals and vitamins are separated from the grain during milling along with the husk.<br><br>
<b>Carbo hydrate:</b> The major carbo hydrate of rice is Strach which is 72-75% tge amylose content of starch varies according to the grain type.
The longer grain and superior types containing upto 17.5% amylose while some coarser types are complete deviot of it.<br><br>
Glutinous rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin. Rice also contains some free sugars like glucose, sucrose, dextrin, fructose and raffinose. The fiber of rice is the hemicellulose made up of pentoses, arabinose and xylose.
<br><br><b>Protein’s:</b> mineral’s, enzymes.
<br><br><b>Pigments of rice:</b> colored, rice contains anthocyanins and carotenoids.<br><br>

<b>Rice cultivation and production:</b>
  Rice cultivation needs a lot of water and is also labor intensive there fore, it is practiced in those places where in the labor cost is less and rain fall is high.
<br><b>Scientific name : </b> oryza sativa, Oryza sativa Asian rice and Oryza glaberrima (Africa rice).
<br><b>Climate:</b> Tropical Climate.
Rice can grow from sea level to an altitude of 3000 meters however, paddy cultivation can also be done in temperate and sub tropical climate under humid conditions. 
A higher temperature, humidity and sufficient rainfall with irrigation facilities are the primary requirements of paddy cultivation. It also bright sunshine with temperature ranging between 20C and 40C.
<br><br><b>Soil</b>
Region with high level of humidity, sufficient rainfall with irrigational facilities, a high temperature, rice can be grown in the almost every type of soil.
The major types of soil’s for rice cultivations are black soil, red soil( loamy and yellow) laterite soil, red sandy, terai, hill and medium to shallow black soil.
PH:
 Rice can be cultivated in both acidic and as wells alkaline soil.
Agronomic practices:
Land preparations -> 2methods
	1)wet cultivation system.
	2)Dry cultivation System.
Plants and fruits, vegetable in summers growing in hot soil. Points to keep in.
<br><b>Soil condition’s :</b> <i>Enriched soil with a PH level between 6.5 and 7
	Sun light : 5-6 Hrs
	Watering: regular in morning.</i>
Fruiting trees that can be produced in the hot soils are as follows
Pomegranate Trees, fig trees ,citrus tree, olive tree, jujube tree

Changes in soil surface temperature in the context of climate problems.<br><br>
Based on observation material’s of hydrometeorological service conducting on the changes of soil surface temperature characteristic over time and the time over changes in (maximums and minimums ) the result in activity of micro and micro organism in the soil layer, an increase in the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, etc are expected.
Restraining buffer for the growth of extreme soil temperature in order to natural and anthropogenic system to ongoing climate changes, microclimate.<br><br>
Changes in air temperature the precipitation  and other meteorological variables and also emphasize the influence of land use, vegetation type its density high soil temperature disrupts energy metabolism implants and present proteins synthesis, cells lose osmotic properties and connections with climate change issue.



<p>Materials and methods.
The research used the materials of long term observations at stationary post’s of the hydrometeorological service of land to study the change In soil surface temperature 3 meteorological station’s  were used.<br><br>
The meteorological stations have some of the longest series of observations of meteorological values, the station belongs to the water balanced station and has one of the longest list’s of measured hydrometeorological parameters.<br><br>
In order to adapt natural and anthropogenic system to the ongoing climate changes it is necessary to fill them with vegetation cover as much as possible, which can reduce the heating of the soil and other surfaces and create a favorable, micro climate, namely plant trees and shrubs do not mow lawn’s without urgent need.<br><br> These measure have a multifaceted purpose-protection from the sun, wind, water, cleaning the air from pollutant’s  filling it with phytoncides that have a beneficial effect on the epidemiological situations etc.
In agriculture apply crop rotations with maximum filling of fields with cultivated vegetation though the year. Apply the strip placement of crops etc.
Quantifying changes in hot temperatures extreme is key for developing adaption strategies changes in hot extreme  are often determined on the basis of air temperatures, how ever hydrology and many biological processes are more sensitive to soil temperature during dry and warm condition’s , the energy absorbed by the soil is used warm the soil increasing the release of sensible heat flux and surface air temperatures.
	<br><br>This increase in surface air temperature leads to a higher atmospheric demand water increasing soil evaporation which may further dry and warm the soil highlighting the contribution of soil moisture temperature feedback to the evolution of hot extreme in a warming climate.<br><br>
	In the presence of persistent high pressure systems moisture deficits and their include reduction in evaporation may lead to the warming of the land and largest fraction of net radiation dissipated as sensible heat into the atmosphere this directly contributes as measured by surface air temperatures, and may further increase soil desiccation and extreme temperatures in down.  <br><br>
<p>Note : Some agriculture crops, vegetables and trees grown by using scientific useful chemicals to produced, we have mentioned only few of them and some international business medicine plants and trees also grown like coco trees and cotton, Tamarind trees, sugar cane etc for importing exporting.


<h1>Geothermal Renewable energy system</h1>
<p> In a desert region planting a geothermal is very challenging task for the conditions in the open sun shine set area , and in condition of running whether becomes very crucial for work done,<br><br>
In the initial first of state small amount of deploying geothermal energy 5 to 8 MW supplying that gives to all over houses training to build with small amount of populations ,<br><br> later slowly growth of population begins and other places for deploying takes 5 to 8 MW supply with millions of treaties can make use of significance enough power supply for the science technology, industrial areas.<br><br>
Planting them close to the water system is becomes very important to function that works significant electric power supply with the heat conditions. Geothermal plants should be located near water sources to ensure efficient cooling and stable electricity generation in hot desert regions. Taking this to the house’s and working area has to maintains requires significant spatial planning for heat management. in a harsh heating weather conditions maintenance must keep checking one after a time proper,
Cooling system that works balancing the machines that  getting over heating and can also be used for the electric functioning .<br><br>

<b>Definition :</b> Geothermal energy, derived from the Earth's internal heat, offers
a promising and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. As the world
grapples with the urgent need to transition to renewable energy sources,
geothermal power stands out for its reliability, low emissions, and
minimal land footprint. <br><br>However, despite its potential, the geothermal
energy sector faces several significant challenges that hinder its
growth and widespread implementation.<br><br> High upfront capital costs,
technological barriers, and regulatory complexities pose obstacles for
developers and investors alike. Additionally, environmental concerns
related to land use, water consumption, and induced seismicity can
complicate project approvals and public acceptance.<br><br><br><br>

Few calculations that proves how geothermal will be necessity according to it available todays technology.
How convert energy → continuous power
1 kW continuous = 8,760 kWh/year.<br><br><br><br>
So required continuous power (MW) = (population × kWh/person/year) ÷ 8,760 ÷ 1,000.
Here are compact scenario numbers (average continuous power required):
•	Per-person 1,000 kWh/year (basic modern minimum):<br><br>
o	100 people → 0.011 MW (≈11 kW)<br><br>
o	1,000 people → 0.11 MW<br><br>
o	5,000 people → 0.57 MW<br><br>
o	10,000 people → 1.14 MW<br><br>
•	Per-person 3,000 kWh/year (moderate/urban):<br><br>
o	1,000 people → 0.34 MW<br><br>
o	5,000 people → 1.71 MW<br><br>
o	10,000 people → 3.42 MW<br><br>
•	Per-person 10,000 kWh/year (high-consumption / industrialised lifestyle + business load):<br><br>
o	1,000 people → 1.14 MW<br><br>
o	5,000 people → 5.71 MW<br><br>
o	10,000 people → 11.4 MW<br><br>
(These follow directly from the conversion above; see general MW→homes discussion for context about “how many homes per MW”.) 
What this means for 5–8 MW of geothermal<br><br>
•	Good for: an initial settlement and community (hundreds-to-a-few-thousand people) with moderate living standards and light businesses, plus some critical infrastructure (water pumps, communications, lights, small manufacturing). Example: 5 MW continuous could comfortably support several thousand people at modest-to-moderate per-capita electricity use. <br><br>
•	Borderline for heavy use: if plan energy-intensive industry (cement, large desalination, heavy manufacturing), or want to host a town of >10,000 people with high per-capita consumption, then 5–8 MW will be insufficient;  would need multiple plants or tens of MW. (Example: 10,000 people at 3,000 kWh/person requires ~3.4 MW ,but add desalination/industry and I have jump past 5–8 MW.) <br><br>
•	Scalability: geothermal is usually developed in phases — single or a few wells now, more wells/units later. Individual well outputs vary, so an initial 5–8 MW plant is a reasonable starter if the resource permits, with capacity to expand if a resource assessment supports more wells. <br><br>
Important non-electrical considerations (they affect how much power  actually need)<br><br>
•	Water / desalination: desert settlements need fresh water — desalination is energy-hungry (adds MWs for large capacity).<br><br>
•	Cooling and HVAC: desert climate increases cooling loads (AC increases consumption).<br><br>
•	Transport, mining, manufacturing: these can multiply demand.<br><br>
•	Grid vs microgrid: in an isolated site you’ll need storage/backup and distribution — geothermal is good as baseload but pairing with solar + batteries is common. <br><br>
Small footprint—Geothermal power plants and geothermal heat pumps are compact. Geothermal power plants use less land per gigawatt-hour (404 m2) than comparable-capacity coal (3,642 m2), wind (1,335 m2), and solar photovoltaic (PV) power stations (3,237 m2) (source). GHPs can be retrofitted or integrated in new buildings.<br><br>

 
				
GP TOTAL CAPATICY	MW	No.Units	Plants types	
	Overa all 10MW or more depending upon population	<br><br>Approx 200	DS,IF,2F,B,H	
Note: Yes=Generally used, No=generally not used, Poss=possibly used under certain circumstances.
Firm and Flexible—Geothermal power plants produce electricity consistently and can run essentially 24 hours per day/7 days per week, regardless of weather conditions. T<br>hey can also ramp generation up or down to respond to changes in electricity demand.<br><br>

<p><b>Electricity Generation</b>
Deep underground, the presence of hot rocks, fluid, and permeability (the ability for that fluid to move among the rocks) offer conditions from which electricity can be generated. <br>Using natural or human-made permeability and fractures, the fluid flows through the hot rocks, absorbing heat from the rocks that can be drawn up through wells to Earth’s surface. <br>That heat energy is then converted to steam, which drives turbines that produce electricity


<p><b>Heating and Cooling </b>
Geothermal resources such as naturally occurring underground reservoirs of hot water or the stable temperature of the subsurface can be used to heat and cool buildings. <br>Geothermal heat pumps provide heating and cooling using the ground as a heat sink, absorbing excess heat when the aboveground temperatures are warmer, and as a heat source when aboveground temperatures are cooler.<br> District heating and cooling systems use one or more types of geothermal systems, such as a series of geothermal heat pumps, in order to heat and cool groups of buildings, campuses, and even entire communities.
